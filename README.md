Regression ML project to predict the price of mobiles based on their features. 
EDA and feature engineering has been performed using basic python library like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
For machine learning sklearn library is been used with various algorithm like linear regression, XDGboost regressor, extra tree regressor with the help of autoML. Then evaluate the model using MSE, MAE, RMSE & r2 score.
